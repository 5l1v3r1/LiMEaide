# LiMEaide
## v1.2.3
## About
LiMEaide is a python application designed to remotely dump RAM of a Linux client and create a volatility profile for later
analysis on your local host. I hope that this will simplify Linux digital forensics in a remote environment. In order to use 
LiMEaide all you need to do is feed a remote Linux client IP address, sit back, and consume your favorite caffeinated beverage.
